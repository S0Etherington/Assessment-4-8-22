    <h3>Summer's life goals</h3>
    <p>
        Ever since I was little my dream was to be a pirate, but those dreams were crushed
        when I realized that I was about 300 years too late and also pirates don't bathe.
        So instead I settled for coding. I have always liked computers, and find joy seeing
        the inner machinations of how things work. Coding in a weird way reminds me of highschool
        math class, which unlike most, is a good thing for me. I'm hoping to use the skills I
        learn to create and expand to new fields.
